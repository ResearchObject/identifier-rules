# 10 Simple rules for design, provision, and reuse of identifiers for web-based life science data

This repository hosts a [wiki](https://github.com/ResearchObject/identifier-rules/wiki) adapted from the 
paper [10 Simple rules for design, provision, and reuse of identifiers for web-based life science data](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.31765) by [Julie A McMurry, et al](Authors).

Feel free to [https://github.com/ResearchObject/identifier-rules/wiki/Contribute](Contribute)!

## Why? Is this wiki official?

At least not at this stage, it's just a private intiative by 
[Stian Soiland-Reyes](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-9718) 
for the purpose of being able to link to individual identifier rules
(or shall we say, give the rules individual identifiers).

I believe the [original preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.31765) is undergoing peer review 
for its submission at [PLoS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/) and 
does not (as far as I know) have its own web site or precense beyond its preprint at Zenodo.
